 Syntax:  COLOR QUESTION <colorno>
          COLOR DATA <colorno>
          COLOR BACKGROUND <colorno 0-7 only>
          COLOR <field name> <color of data> <color of question>

 The COLOR command specifies the color for either the entire questionnaire
 (with QUESTION, DATA, or BACKGROUND), or for a single field. <Colorno> is an
 integer from 0 to 255 that specifies the color of text and background that
 will be used on the screen. To see the possibilities, press <F9> from the
 main menu to view the Setup screen where all 256 combinations are displayed.

 The word QUESTION refers to text on the screen outside of data entry blanks.
 DATA is the text inside entry blanks.  BACKGROUND is the background area.

 The colors specified do not take effect until the screen is next updated,
 usually when the bottom of a screen is reached.  To produce an immediate
 effect, the UPDATE command should follow the COLOR command.  COLOR commands
 applying to an entire questionnaire should be placed in a BEFORE FILE or
 BEFORE RECORD block.
